Quantum mechanics predicts that particles may tunnel through a potenial barrier, instead of being 
reflected as predicted by classical mechanics. The probability of a quantum mechanical wavefunction 
tunneling through a potential barrier can be found analytically by solving Schrodingers equation, 
however for most potentials a numerical solutions is required. 

In this project a Runge-Kutta method is used to solve a dimensionless Schrodinger equation. Due to
its accuracy in solving differential equations using the predictor-corrector algorithm. The algorithm
takes an intial value problem and iterates the x and y values using derived formulae. The x values
are iterated using a chosen step size apropriate for the differential being modelled. The y iteration
is a weighted average of four values. Each of the values is an estimate for the change in y value
between two points.

The Schrodinger equation is a second order differential equation and must converted in two partial
differential equations of the first order. By considering a complex wavefunction each first order 
differential equation is solved twice, for the real and imaginary parts of the wavefunction. To
find the solutions to the wavefunction for all space inside the potential barrier the simulation 
intergrates backwards from the end of the barrier. Finally the solutions to the differential 
eqUations are used to determine the coeffiecents for incident and reflected waves.

To check the accuracy of the numerical solutions, the simulations result for an exact case is 
compared to the analytical result. Once in agreement the simulation can be run for various other 
Potentials.
