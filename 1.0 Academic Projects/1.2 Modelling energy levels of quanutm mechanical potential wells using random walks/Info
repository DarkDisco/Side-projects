The project models the energy states of a quanutm mechanical potential well using random walks.
A random walk is a mathematical method of describing the path taking by a point of interest. For 
example a random walk on an integer number line with different probabilites for moving in either
the positive or negative direction will result in a path traced out on the number line after N
integer steps are taken.

An extra feature need to describe a potential well in a semi-classical regime is the probabilty 
of the random walk being terminated. The termination of the random walk must depend on the
potential at that point in space. The rate of termination is found by counting the number of
walks that last n steps. Then plotting the log of the number of terminated walks against n steps.

The one-dimensional case considers a particle confined in an infinite square potential which is 
discribed by a one-dimensional schrodinger equation. The random walk termination rate is related
to the energy level of the potential well via an equation and constants. Serval 100 iterations
with walks that have reached the max number of steps is required to get a reliable energy value.

The two-dimensional case considers a walker that can move to one of four adjacent lattice postions with
equal probability. A circular potential terminates a walk if it reaches the circumference of the circle 
or reaches a nodal line caused by the symmetry of the potential and energy state of the system.
