The critical mass of Uranium defines the minimum size at which a chain reaction can occur if the 
fission process is not controlled by limiting the number of thermal neutrons avaliable.

By using a Monte Carlo simulation the inhrent uncertainity in the production and absorption of
thermal neutrons within a Uranium sample can be account for. The simulaton allows for probability 
distribution to describe the likelyhood of a secondary fission event occuring within the length 
scales of the Uranium sample. The simulation runs multiple itterations so that a distribution of the
possible outcomes of the situation presented. Probability distributions are a realisatic way of
discribing the uncertainty of an event for risk analyis.
